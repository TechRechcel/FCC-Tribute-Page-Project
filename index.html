        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dennis Ritchie's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>September 9, 1941</strong> - Born in Bronxville, New York,
            U.S.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1967</strong> - Began working at the Bell Labs Computing
            Sciences Research Center
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1968</strong> - Defended his PhD thesis on "Program
            Structure and Computational Complexity" at Harvard under the
            supervision of Patrick C. Fischer. However, Ritchie never officially
            received his PhD degree
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>October 12, 2011</strong> - died at the age of 70 at
            Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, U.S.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          "Ritchie, on the other hand, invented and co-invented two key software
          technologies which make up the DNA of effectively every single
          computer software product we use directly or even indirectly in the
          modern age. It sounds like a wild claim, but it really is true."[42]
          Another said, "many in computer science and related fields knew of
          Ritchie’s importance to the growth and development of, well,
          everything to do with computing" <br /><br />
